This code preprocesses text to extract keywords while excluding stop words. First, it removes single Cyrillic and Latin characters, standalone Latin words, and words containing a mix of Cyrillic and Latin characters. Then, it replaces multiple spaces with a single space to improve text structure. Using the NLTK library, stop words that carry no semantic value are removed. The remaining words are normalized with the pymorphy2 library, reducing them to their base form (lemmatization), which helps work with word roots while ignoring inflections and forms. As a result, a cleaned and lemmatized word sample is obtained, suitable for further analysis or keyword extraction. The code is written in Python 3 using the nltk, pymorphy2, and re libraries.
